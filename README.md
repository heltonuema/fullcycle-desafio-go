Repository for delivering the code of the Fullcycle Docker course challenge. 
The proposed challenge is to create an image with less than 2 megabytes that,
when executed, display the massage "Fullcycle rocks".

As message is generated by a Go application, there is a Go test for this feature.
The image maximum size is tested by the Github Action pipeline set in ci.yaml
file. This pipeline is triggered in pull requests to master, pushes to master
and tag creation. The pipeline creates a coverage report, build the Docker image
and publish it when triggered by tag.

To pull this image:

```
docker pull helton/fullcycle-desafio-go
```

To run this image:

```
docker run helton/fullcycle-desafio-go
```
